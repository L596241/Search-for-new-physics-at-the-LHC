# Search for New Physics at the LHC

Welcome to our exciting project where we delve into the realm of particle physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, we embark on a journey to build a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between Standard Model (SM) processes and a unique extension of the SM featuring the elusive Z' particle, also known as the Z Prime Boson. Additionally, we explore techniques for estimating the mass of the Z' particle using simulated Monte Carlo (MC) data. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, we aim to push the boundaries of particle physics exploration. Success in this endeavor holds the promise of providing physicists with invaluable tools to deepen our understanding of the universe, potentially shedding light on enigmatic phenomena such as dark matter, which currently challenges the predictions of the Standard Model.

While the project notebooks are available here, we highly recommend using the Kaggle notebook environment for an interactive experience. By accessing the provided Kaggle notebooks, you can easily copy and modify them, experimenting with different techniques to potentially enhance various aspects of the models.
